1. We do not care or the order of the numbers. We just need to know which ones are in our sum.
2. Numbers on a rectangle obviously have the same distance from each other.
3. When jumping to the next layer of the spiral, the distance is the same as within the layer (because of the step out)
4. The number of steps increases by 2 after 4 jumps, because of one upper and lower or left and right number.
5. We now our spiral is full when we are at n = 1001x1001
