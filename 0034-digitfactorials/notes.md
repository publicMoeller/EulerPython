1. We can probably just test all we need.
2. Where do we need to test?
    the value factorial digit sum must be able to be bigger than the number so we test numbers with x digits:
    log10(x)*9! = x
3. Wolfram alpha says between 0 and 2,3*10^6 is enough. So we will test up to about 10^7 since performance is less concern than finding the exact point
